Lesson 5


We skipped Lesson 4 because why not?

In the list of initial instructions, Lesson 5 told us to open the file “Dub Beat,” though we didn’t make substantial use of it.  Most of this lesson was trying something out, then quitting without saving.  I used the “Dub Beat” file in order to do some of the earlier exercises anyway.

Our first task was to open up a new software track and get “Steinway Grand Piano” from the library.

We played around for a while with the reverberation on Bus 1 and 2, which affected what sort of room it sounded like the piano was being played in.  Then we were told to quit without saving, but for the time being all I did was delete the piano track.

Our next task was to build a synthesizer patch.  We created two new software tracks: Nightlife Lead and 70s Analog Lead.  (I personally didn’t enjoy the way this sounded, but an assignment is an assignment.). We stacked the two and named it Thick Bass.  This time, we saved the patch into the library.

We then added a new software track, a bass called Dirty Fifth (I originally misread it as ‘dirty filth’.)

The next task was how to assign the smart controls to the Ringshifter.  We opened up the smart controls and deleted all patch mappings.

![4](/Images/L5S4.png)

Then we clicked the red “Learn” button such that the first knob corresponded to the big frequency dial on the Ringshifter.  We played with the way that sounded for a while and saved it that way.

The textbook then wanted us to mess with the knobs and dials on our keyboard, rather than virtual knobs and dials in the computer.  However, the keyboards in our classroom do not have knobs and dials to speak of—they are just electric pianos.  Therefore, I skipped this section.  The textbook then asked us once again to quit without saving.

Finally, the textbook actually told us to open “Dub Beat.”  I had been using it all along, so I just deleted the other tracks we had been messing with.  This time, we were to play with the arpeggiator.  Our instrument for this exercise was the Retro Synth, which opened up a big plug-in, then turned on the arpeggiator.

![5](/Images/L5S5.png)

This was an awful lot of fun to play with.  I mostly fiddled around, alternating d minor and g minor chords.  We played with latching the arpeggios so that we didn’t have to hold the keys down, transposing the chords, switching around the note order and the octaves, messing with the amplifier envelope, and adjusting the rate knob.  Once again, we were told to quit without saving, so I deleted the synth track.

For the next exercise, we were to open a new software track with a Steinway Grand Piano.

This time, we would be focusing on the LCD display and watching how it changes as we hit the keys.  We added a metronome, opened the Piano Roll, then got ready to record.

![7](/Images/L5S7.png)

We were asked to record a simple bass line on the piano.  It saved in green.

![9](/Images/L5S9.png)

Our next task was quantizing, to make the quarter notes line up exactly with the metronome.  This was an awkward adjustment—it’s been several years since I played any piano, but I had thought my timing better than THAT.

![10](/Images/L5S10.png)

We then tried again with a new bass line and quantized that to the nearest 1/8th note.

![11](/Images/L5S11.png)

Next, we were to add some extra chords to the bass line we already had.

![14](/Images/L5S14.png)

I loved the way this sounded, but the textbook told us to quit without saving.  I finally took the hint and quit properly, starting a new project.  This time, we would use the drum kit “Brooklyn.”

![15](/Images/L5S15.png)

We went into cycle mode and recorded the drum as the textbook asked of us.

![16](/Images/L5S16.png)

Then, we opened a Take folder and added a new software instrument, Stinger Bass.  This was a fun instrument—it reminded me of Seinfeld.  We futzed around for a bit on cycle mode until we recorded something we liked that went with the drums, then flattened the Take Folder so as only to hear our favorite take.

![17](/Images/L5S17.png)

I bounced this recording so that there would be something to listen to from this lesson.

Lesson 6


For lesson 6, we began by opening the file “Rock Drums,” and added the Stinger Bass, making sure that the Piano Roll was open.

![1](/Images/L6S1.png)

Most of our work in this lesson would be using the Piano Roll, so we expanded that.  Instead of using the keys on our keyboard, this time we would be clicking the virtual keys on the screen in order to produce the notes we wanted.  We added some notes and play with resizing them.  We filled out the bass line to hit all the notes the textbook wanted us to.  There wasn’t much room for creativity here, though we did practice moving pitches around to add little touches here and there.

![5](/Images/L6S5.png)

Then, we would mess with note velocity, which would affect how hard the computer’s virtual robofingers were hitting the virtual keys.  We did that until both we and the textbook were happy with it.

![8](/Images/L6S8.png)

We converted our drum line into a MIDI region.

![9](/Images/L6S9.png)

Then we started messing with the brush tool.  I had a bit of a problem with this—creating the pattern was simple, but I found myself unable to save it as a brush pattern.  It turned out that what I needed to do was make ABSOLUTE SURE to turn on the Advance Tools.  After this, things worked the way that they were supposed to.

![11](/Images/L6S11.png)

We used the brush tool to paint the pattern twice and mess with its velocity, as well.

![14](/Images/L6S14.png)

We then imported the file “Lead Synth,” a prerecorded keyboard bit.  It started out being played on a piano, and it started out sounding a little weird.

![15](/Images/L6S15.png)

First, we changed the instrument to “Citrus Fuzz,” rather than a grand piano.  (This wasn’t a sound I cared for, but a lesson is a lesson.). Then we tried to mess with the volume and the pan, but those wouldn’t budge—they kept going back to where they had been.  To fix this, we had to open the Event List.

![16](/Images/L6S16.png)

We hid all the ‘note’ events and deleted all the ‘Control’ and ‘C-Press’ events.  Then we clicked the ‘notes’ button again so that the notes were all that remained.  They asked us to raise the volume of the synth while we adjusted the pan knob, but I thought the synth was too loud already, so I refused.

Next, we displayed the Lead Synth in the Piano Roll Editor.  We transposed a few notes, just to see if we could, but they sounded awful.

![17](/Images/L6S17.png)

We quantized the notes so that they would be on beat just right, then tweaked it so that they WOULDN’T be just right, because of the aesthetic.  This involved using the Strength slider on the quantizer.

Next, we used the MIDI Draw feature.  This brought up essentially a scatter plot under the Piano Roll.

![18](/Images/L6S18.png)

We drew in a crescendo at the beginning of the line and made that crescendo louder with the velocity slider.

![19](/Images/L6S19.png)

Then, we began playing with pitch.  We used the Pitch Bend feature to mess with the beginning of the line.

![20](/Images/L6S20.png)

We used the ES2 plug-in to adjust the range of the bend to cover a whole octave, so that it didn’t sound weird anymore.

![21](/Images/L6S21.png)

The textbook also asked us to yoink the line around a little bit to make it curve.

![22](/Images/L6S22.png)

We continued to use the bend feature to put little scoops in the middle notes.  I thought it was a little cheesy, but I did as the lesson requested.

![23](/Images/L6S23.png)

If we’re going to be cheesy, we’re going to be cheesy.  The next task was to add vibrato to the sustained note using Modulation.  It felt like using the whammy bar on a guitar (though my experience with such is limited to “Guitar Hero.”).  Finally, we used the Smart Controls to ramp up the “Scream” knob.

![24](/Images/L6S24.png)

Thus ended lesson 6.  I did not bother to bounce this particular piece, as it would probably sound exactly like everyone else’s.
