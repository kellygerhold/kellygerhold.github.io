Lesson 5


We skipped Lesson 4 because why not?

In the list of initial instructions, Lesson 5 told us to open the file “Dub Beat,” though we didn’t make substantial use of it.  Most of this lesson was trying something out, then quitting without saving.  I used the “Dub Beat” file in order to do some of the earlier exercises anyway.

Our first task was to open up a new software track and get “Steinway Grand Piano” from the library.

We played around for a while with the reverberation on Bus 1 and 2, which affected what sort of room it sounded like the piano was being played in.  Then we were told to quit without saving, but for the time being all I did was delete the piano track.

Our next task was to build a synthesizer patch.  We created two new software tracks: Nightlife Lead and 70s Analog Lead.  (I personally didn’t enjoy the way this sounded, but an assignment is an assignment.). We stacked the two and named it Thick Bass.  This time, we saved the patch into the library.

We then added a new software track, a bass called Dirty Fifth (I originally misread it as ‘dirty filth’.)

The next task was how to assign the smart controls to the Ringshifter.  We opened up the smart controls and deleted all patch mappings.

Then we clicked the red “Learn” button such that the first knob corresponded to the big frequency dial on the Ringshifter.  We played with the way that sounded for a while and saved it that way.

The textbook then wanted us to mess with the knobs and dials on our keyboard, rather than virtual knobs and dials in the computer.  However, the keyboards in our classroom do not have knobs and dials to speak of—they are just electric pianos.  Therefore, I skipped this section.  The textbook then asked us once again to quit without saving.

Finally, the textbook actually told us to open “Dub Beat.”  I had been using it all along, so I just deleted the other tracks we had been messing with.  This time, we were to play with the arpeggiator.  Our instrument for this exercise was the Retro Synth, which opened up a big plug-in, then turned on the arpeggiator.

This was an awful lot of fun to play with.  I mostly fiddled around, alternating d minor and g minor chords.  We played with latching the arpeggios so that we didn’t have to hold the keys down, transposing the chords, switching around the note order and the octaves, messing with the amplifier envelope, and adjusting the rate knob.  Once again, we were told to quit without saving, so I deleted the synth track.

For the next exercise, we were to open a new software track with a Steinway Grand Piano.

This time, we would be focusing on the LCD display and watching how it changes as we hit the keys.  We added a metronome, opened the Piano Roll, then got ready to record.

We were asked to record a simple bass line on the piano.  It saved in green.

Our next task was quantizing, to make the quarter notes line up exactly with the metronome.  This was an awkward adjustment—it’s been several years since I played any piano, but I had thought my timing better than THAT.

We then tried again with a new bass line and quantized that to the nearest 1/8th note.

Next, we were to add some extra chords to the bass line we already had.

I loved the way this sounded, but the textbook told us to quit without saving.  I finally took the hint and quit properly, starting a new project.  This time, we would use the drum kit “Brooklyn.”

![15](/Images/L5S15.png)

We went into cycle mode and recorded the drum as the textbook asked of us.

![16](/Images/L5S16.png)

Then, we opened a Take folder and added a new software instrument, Stinger Bass.  This was a fun instrument—it reminded me of Seinfeld.  We futzed around for a bit on cycle mode until we recorded something we liked that went with the drums, then flattened the Take Folder so as only to hear our favorite take.

I bounced this recording so that there would be something to listen to from this lesson.
