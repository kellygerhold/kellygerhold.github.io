Lesson 2 began in a slightly confusing fashion—the book suggested that they wanted us to open up a pre-created logic project, rather than continue to use our own.  We just ignored that and just kept trucking.

I had recorded a bit of whistling already, so I was familiar with adding tracks and using the microphone.  I messed around with the amps and the tuning, but they weren’t particularly useful at this time.  I recorded a new whistling track (several takes thereof.)  I also created a new track called “TESTING STUFF” so that I could test stuff.

I then proceeded to record some six million takes (actually closer to 12) of a vocal track.  This early in the process, I was unfamiliar with editing technology (like punching, for example), so I just recorded take after take after take in cycle mode until I got one that I liked.  Since I ended up with a take I was satisfied with, I didn’t end up messing with punching after all.

The voice track was a bit too loud, so I messed with that a bit to get a better balance.  I then renamed “TESTING STUFF” to “voice”.

I then proceeded to record some six million whistling takes, figuring that I may as well.  I liked my original whistling solo, but why not try to improve upon it?  So I did a ton of those in cycle mode.  At the end of the day, though, I was happiest with my first and original whistling take.

The textbook suggested several other recording-related things I could do, but they weren’t terribly applicable to the sort of recording I was doing, so I did not do them.

I proceeded to delete all the takes I wasn’t using, since all my edits thus far would be nondestructive anyway.  However, I ran into a problem.  The takes I had been recording on the voice track were separate from each other, and since nothing connected them, they wouldn’t create a comp file.  When I tried to play it, they wouldn’t play at all.  What I ended up doing was recording a take with literally nothing in it, just for the purpose of comping the previous takes together.

Then, I proceeded to permanently delete all my unused files, since they were just sitting there taking up memory.  This ended Lesson 2.

Lesson 3 began the editing.  I played around with some of the features, but again, many didn’t apply particularly well to what I was up to.  My tracks didn’t exactly have “regions” to play individually.  Additionally, I had already worked with comping my takes (or at least I’d jury-rigged something to achieve that effect), so the textbook wasn’t terribly helpful there either, especially considering that we’d deleted our unused tracks at the end of Lesson 2.  I did mess around with the colors on the track that I’d comped, though.

This is also around when I finally figured out how compressors worked.  I had wanted to do something to make the whistle solo stand out a little better and bring up the quieter notes, so there we are.

Next, we played with fades.  Once I learned how to make them, I put them everywhere (or at least everywhere on the piano part.)  I had felt all along like the piano stopped and started too abruptly, so now I felt I could fix that.  All my recordings sort of faded naturally, so I felt no need to adjust those.

Then, I added the white noise track the textbook suggested.  I liked the sound of it, so I edited it as recommended, though I let it start a little earlier (at bar 16 rather than 17, to allow more buildup.)

Finally, the textbook suggested playing things backward.  It wanted us to mess with a recorded guitar track, but I didn’t have one.  Instead, for the fun of it, I took the tail end of the piano track and ran that backward instead, placing it right before the piano begins.  It was THE COOLEST THING EVER.  I don’t know why, but that one little thing made everything more exciting and interesting and I loved it.

The textbook suggested aligning audio, but I had been doing that all along, so I felt no need for it. All I had to do was bounce the new file.  Thus ended Lesson 3.

Here is the result.
