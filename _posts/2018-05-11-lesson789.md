Lessons 7 8 9 (and extra)


Lessons 7, 8, and 9 were mostly about making edits to pre-existing pieces, rather than about creating anything new.  This is valuable, as it teaches necessary skills, but the end results are inevitably uninteresting.  As such, I additionally came up with my own piece, which will be included at the end of this post.  The post will nevertheless go through the lessons.


Lesson 7

Lesson 7 began with some simple exercises to mess with tempo and key.  We began by importing the file “Slow Drums” and setting it at its original tempo.  Then, we threw in a couple loops, particularly Intergalactic Beat and Intergalactic Rising Synth.

In order to make these sound their best, however, we needed to adjust the key of the project.

The next task was turning the “Slow Drums” into a loop.  Relatively easily done, and not with much to look at.

We then started playing around with tempo possibilities.  This is the first time we ever used the Global Tracks.  We were to mess only with the tempo track.  We created two separate tempo sets, one of which will be moving faster than the original.  This involved changing the Flex Mode to Slicing.

Then we started messing around with the new tempo.  We started at one level, then added a tempo shift to make it faster.  This was extremely abrupt, so we smoothed it out, then dropped the end to go even slower than the beginning.  The last trick to this one was adding a turntable-style slow-down to the last measure.

That said, we didn’t save any of this.  None of it was intended to be permanent.  We instead just jumped onto the next thing, which was to open the project “Swing Groove.”  This was an exercise in syncing up disparate tracks.  We were to turn the drums into the Groove Track, which would compel the maracas to follow it.

Again, this was just to see how that feature worked—we weren’t meant to do anything with it.

The bulk of Lesson 7 was instead messing around with a rock song: Little Lady.  We would be editing and enhancing this song for the rest of the lesson.

![12](/Images/L7S12.png)

Our first assignment was just to play around with the Varispeed feature.

![13](/Images/L7S13.png)

A tip here is that the automatic Varispeed settings are NOT “speed only” and “percentage,” so the user needs to make absolute sure to specify before starting.  This was kind of fun, futzing around with the speed and pitch of the song.  Apparently it could be used for some fine-tuning if a singer can’t sing (speeding it up like Alvin and the Chipmunks), but after playing with it we just turned it off.  Our subsequent edits were intended to be permanent.

Our next task was to mess with the Breakdown section of the song.  We needed to take the two guitar parts and make sure that they were playing at the same time.  This involved using the Track Flex button.  With this feature applied, we could yoink the waveforms around, stretching or extending them as necessary to make them begin and end when we pleased.  To do this, we had to click the tracks and add Flex Markers, or else any changes we made would affect the entire track.

![17](/Images/L7S17.png)

This was the difficult part, for me.  Clicking the track created Flex Markers, but which Flex Marker did what was often unclear to me.  I often accidentally dragged both tracks around, or else I accidentally dragged the entire line of a track.  I handled this mostly through trial and error.

The next task was to edit the timing of a note without stretching it (because apparently that sounds more natural.)  This involved command-dragging some Flex Markers around using the marquee tool, which would chop the track into bits and let you drag and drop the bits around.  We did this to a couple places in the Breakdown section.

![19](/Images/L7S19.png)

We then used the Flex tool to drag out a bass note.  Again, it was difficult for me to make sure I was clicking and stretching the right part of the track.

![20](/Images/L7S20.png)

Our last bit of Lesson 7 was adjusting the vocal track.  I will admit that I didn’t hear any problems with the vocal track in its original form—notes that were slightly flat just felt like stylistic choices to me.  But the lesson wanted us to mess with it anyway, so mess we did.

We turned on Flex, then chose Flex Pitch, which opened up the Piano Roll Editor and showed the vocal track in the form of weird abstract mathematic art.

![21](/Images/L7S21.png)
![23](/Images/L7S23.png)

We adjusted that to Perfect Pitch and futzed around with the vibrato, but that made it sound like a robot was singing it, so the lesson then made us very specifically re-mess up the singing.  We then fixed one note by dragging it to where it was intended, to hide a spot where the singer was flat.  They encouraged us to do more if we felt like it, but I thought that was rather pointless, since I liked it fine in the first place.  Thus ended Lesson 7.

Between Lessons 7 and 8, our class took a bit of a break to play with the Vocal Transformer.  I used this plug-in to make myself sound like Kylo Ren from the new Star Wars movies.

Lesson 8

This lesson exclusively involved working with the song “Raise It Up.”  Our goal was to essentially remix the song.  

Our first area to tweak was the percussion.  We were to loop the kick drum so that we’d get more of that going on, then converted those loops into regions so that we could mess with them individually.  We resized all the beats so that they would end a little shorter, with each successive beat lasting longer.  (I forgot to take screenshots during most of this part, but considering it’s only a brief portion of Lesson 8, I figure that’s not a problem.)

![3](/Images/L8S3.png)

We then looked into alternate ways to achieve this sort of thing, without messing with each section individually.  Part of this involved creating a folder around the Big Kick drum track, so that we could extend the track to a loopable number of bars.  (Then we looped like there was no tomorrow.)

Our next trick was to clone Track 2.  This is done from the main toolbar, where one chooses Edit and Repeat Multiple.  As many clones as you want, and unlike in the Star Wars prequels, what you do to one clone affects all the others, so you can essentially make mass-edits.  (This is why you clone instead of loop.)  Along these lines, you can add fades to all the clones at once.

![6](/Images/L8S6.png)

It’s annoying and a lot of computer space to have all of these separate regions, though, so we mashed them all together again.

![7](/Images/L8S7.png)
![8](/Images/L8S8.png)

We then went through, in my opinion, a lesson in futility.  We created a track alternative and messed around with that some, and then did not use the alternative for anything.

Moving onward, we then started messing with the verses.  The verse and chorus bled into each other in the original arrangement, so we would be separating them.  We added a bar of nothing.

![9](/Images/L8S9.png)

Then we filled this bar with whatever was appropriate to put there.  The end result was a gap long enough that you could hear the end of the first line and then the beginning of the second.  (I did not bother to screenshot any of the rest of this.)

We then experimented with chopping sections of the song out.  At first, we were to get rid of the entire breakdown, but that was terrible.  Instead, we erased right around bar 37.

![11](/Images/L8S11.png)

We then messed with that until the lesson was happy with it.

We ended lesson 8 by working with the Na-na-nas.  These had been recorded such that there were bits of noise where they weren’t supposed to be.  First we went in and deleted the gaps by hand.  After that, though, we got lazy and just used the Remove Silence function.  We had to mess with the parameters a bit, so that accidental sounds wouldn’t be mistaken for music.

![15](/Images/L8S15.png)

A little more tweaking (in particular editing out one entire track and replacing it with repeats of a more successful attempt), and the song was finished.

![16](/Images/L8S1.png)


Lesson 9

This lesson was all about mixing the song “BIG.”  That said, however, I was starting also to begin my own personal project, which I’m calling “For Fun.”

Back to lesson 9 proper, though.  The song “BIG” first asked us to take all the percussion tracks and sum them into a stack, to make life simpler.

![6](/Images/L9S6.png)

We also practiced switching between the tracks area and the mixer, ideally to make things more convenient.  With that many tracks, it makes sense.  We also messed with locking the screen such that only relevant features turn up.

![7](/Images/L9S7.png)
![8](/Images/L9S8.png)

Our next task was to add an amp to the guitar part.

![9](/Images/L9S9.png)

We futzed around with this for a while until it achieved the result the lesson wanted us to achieve.  I will admit that I am a complete philistine and couldn’t tell the difference between some of the changes, particularly moving the mic around on the fake speaker.  In general, throughout all the changes we were to make to this song, I was just taking the textbook’s word for it that it would sound better.

We then messed with the pan knobs, to balance the sound out a little better, and started working with the buses.  I’m still not exactly sure what buses are in this context, but I do know that it is a way to mess with multiple tracks at once (by putting those tracks in a stack and assigning the stack to a bus.)  We used this to add tremolo to a section.

![10](/Images/L9S9.png)
![11](/Images/L9S10.png)

Then, we were to mess with only one section of a region, adding an effect that would go away later.

![12](/Images/L9S11.png)

The next bit was a little harder for me.  We were to add EQ plug-ins to a section.  I kept accidentally moving dots that weren’t supposed to move.  I was never able to get the red section to do the swoop that the textbook showed.  I figured I got close enough.

![13](/Images/L9S12.png)

After messing with the EQ plug-in, we added reverb to some of the vocals, apparently just for kicks.  This also involved messing around with buses.

![14](/Images/L9S13.png)

This allowed us to tweak how much reverb we actually wanted, which was apparently not that much.

Our next task was to use a compressor, which was more relevant to the sort of thing I want to do in my own work (whistling tends to be disproportionately quiet.)  I didn’t remember to take any screenshots of this part, but I appreciated getting to test it out and figure out what all the knobs do.

Finally, we were to look at the Limiter to master the mix.  First, we tacked a compressor onto the entire song, to make sure that no part of it was too loud.  Then, we added an Adaptive Limiter, messing with the gain knob until we were happy with it.  Thus ended Lesson 9.

![5](/Images/L9S5.png)

I remember enjoying a particular baseline that I ran into back in lesson 1, the Reign Supreme bass, so I started building a song around that.  I threw in some electric piano, using techniques from lesson 6, and some whistling, which I edited using tricks from lesson 8 (mainly removing unwanted noise.)  I kept building on that until it was something I liked (and I threw in some amps because why not?)

Using the sum of my knowledge, without further ado, this is “For Fun.”
